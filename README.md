# web-scraping-challenge

This assignment had me stumped at several points, but it has also given me a very in-depth understanding of how web-scraping is done. 
From it also learned how Flask interacts with html through render_template, which will prove to be very useful in the future when 
loading data from a database such as mongodb into html. In addition I've learned that functions are a sure-fire way to make sure 
that your elements are properly imported. I was unable to figure out how to quit the browser after app.py is initially started.
However, I'm sure that with more time I could be able to figure out as I may find myself coming back to this assignment in the future.
